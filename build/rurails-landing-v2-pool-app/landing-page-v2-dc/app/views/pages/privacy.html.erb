Unless expressly stated otherwise within the scope of this Privacy Policy, the data stored with us are deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their designated purpose and the deletion is not opposed by any statutory retention duties. Insofar as the data are not deleted, because they are required for other and legally admissible purposes, their processing is restricted.

Optionally, additional biographical data can be entered, which relate to e.g. the curriculum vitae, interests etc. Within the scope of the registration, the required mandatory details are notified to the users. In future, this list may be extended with reference to the legal foundations referred to in Point 1. Furthermore, curriculum vitae and application data may be sent to our Online Services. These may be made available to recruiting companies, only after the user’s consent has been obtained. If users have canceled their user account, their data will be deleted in respect of the user account, unless their retention is necessary for commercial-law or tax-law reasons in accordance with Art. 6 Subsection 1 lit. c GDPR.

                        <li>Deletion occurs after the expiration of statutory warranty and comparable duties, the necessity to retain the data is checked every three years; in the case of statutory archiving duties, the deletion occurs after their expiration (end of commercial-code (6 years) and tax-law (10 years) retention duty); details in the customer account remain until their deletion.</li>

The use occurs on the basis of our legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 Subsection 1 lit. f) GDPR. With the assistance of this service, comments from real people are distinguished from spam comments. For this, all comment details are sent to a server in the USA, where they are analyzed and stored for four days, for comparison purposes. If a comment has been classified as spam, the data about this is stored beyond this period of time. These details include the entered name, the e-mail address, the IP address, the comment content, the referrer, details about the browser used and the computer system and the time of the entry.</p>

Pseudonymous utilization profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.</li>
                        <li>We use Google Analytics in order to display the advertisements placed by Google and its partners within marketing services only to those users, who also have shown an interest in our online services or show specific characteristics (e.g. interests in specific topics or products, which are determined on the basis of the visited websites), which we send to Google (so-called “Remarketing”, or “Google Analytics Audiences”). With the assistance of the Remarketing Audiences, we also intend to ensure that our advertisements match the potential interest of the users and are not annoying for them.</li>
                        <li>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. However, in the case of activation of IP anonymization on this website, your IP address will be previously abbreviated by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other Member States, which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

                    <h2>Google Re/Marketing Services</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and commercial operation of our online services within the meaning of Art. 6 Subsection 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use the Marketing and Remarketing Services (in short “Google Marketing Services”) of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).</li>
                        <li>The Google Marketing Services allow us to display advertising for and on our website in a more targeted manner, in order to present users only with advertisements, which potentially match their interests. If advertisements are e.g. displayed for products, for which the user has shown an interest on other websites, this is referred to as “Remarketing”. For this purpose, when accessing our website and others, on which Google Marketing Services are active, a Google code is directly executed by Google and so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also referred to as “web beacons”) are integrated into the website. With the aid of these, an individual cookie is stored on the users’ device, i.e. a small file (comparable technologies may also be used, instead of cookies). The cookies may be set by various domains, among others, by google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. In this file, it is noted which websites the user visits, which contents he has shown an interest in and which offers he has clicked on, furthermore, technical information about the browser and operating system, linking websites, visit time and other details about the use of the online services. The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby, within the scope of Google Analytics, we inform you that the IP is abbreviated within the Member States of the European Union or in other Member States, which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and are only transferred in full to a server of Google in the USA and abbreviated there in exceptional cases. The IP address is not combined with data of the user within other Google services. The information referred to above may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user subsequently visits other websites, customized advertisements, which match his interests, may be displayed to him.</li>
                        <li>The users’ data are processed within the scope of the Google Marketing Services pseudonym. I.e. Google does not store and process e.g. the name of e-mail address of the user, but processes the relevant data on the basis of cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. I.e. from Google’s point of view, the advertisements are not managed and displayed for a concretely identified person, but for the cookie-holder, regardless of who this cookie-holder is. This does not apply, if a Google user has expressly allowed the data to be processed without this pseudonymization. The information collected by Google Marketing Services about the users are sent to Google and store on Google’s servers in the USA.</li>
                        <li>The Google Marketing Services, which we use, include, inter alia, the “Google AdWords” online marketing program. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different “conversion cookie”. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained using the cookie have the purpose of creating conversion statistics for AdWords customers, who have chosen conversion tracking. The AdWords customers find out the total number of users, who have clicked on their advertisement and have been forwarded to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information, with which users can be personally identified.</li>
                        <li>On the basis of the Google Marketing Services, we can integrate third-party “DoubleClick” advertisements. DoubleClick uses cookies, with which Google and its partner websites are enabled to place advertisements on the basis of visits by users to this website/other websites on the Internet.</li>
                        <li>On the basis of the Google Marketing Services, we can integrate third-party “AdSense” advertisements. AdSense uses cookies, with which Google and its partner websites are enabled to place advertisements on the basis of visits by users to this website/other websites on the Internet.</li>
                        <li>We can also use the “Google Optimizer” service. Within the scope of so-called ”A/B Testing”, Google Optimizer allows us to trace what effect various changes to a website have (e.g. changes to the input fields, the design, etc.). For these test purposes, cookies are filed on the users’ devices. Only pseudonymized user data are processed for this.</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, we can use the “Google Tag Manager” in order to integrate the Google Analysis and Marketing Services into our website and manage them.</li>
                        <li>Further information about data use for marketing purposes by Google is available on the overview page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>, the Privacy Policy of Google is accessible at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>

                        <li>Within our online services, on the basis of our legitimate interests in analysis, optimization and commercial operation of our online services and for these purposes, the so-called “Facebook Pixel” of the Facebook social network is used, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you are domiciled in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook").</li>
                        <li>Using the Facebook Pixel, it is possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online services as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called “Facebook Ads”. Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel display Facebook Ads, which we have placed, only to those Facebook users, who also have shown an interest in our online services or show specific characteristics (e.g. interests in specific topics or products, which are determined on the basis of the visited websites), which we send to Facebook (so-called “Custom Audiences”). With the assistance of the Facebook Pixel, we also intend to ensure that our Facebook Ads match the potential interest of the users and are not annoying for them. With the assistance of the Facebook Pixel, we can also trace the effectiveness of the Facebook advertisements for statistical and marketing purposes, by seeing whether users are forwarded to our website after clicking on a Facebook advertisement (so-called “conversion”).</li>
                        <li>Furthermore, for the use of the Facebook Pixel, we use the additional “extended comparison” function (data, such as telephone numbers, e-mail addresses or Facebook IDS of the users) are used to form target groups (“custom audiences” or “look-alike audiences”), which are sent to Facebook (encrypted)). Additional information about the “extended comparison”: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668</a>).</li>
                        <li>We also use the “Custom Audiences from File” procedure of the social network Facebook, Inc. In this case, the e-mail addresses of the newsletter recipients are uploaded at Facebook. The upload procedure occurs in an encrypted form. The upload is exclusively for the purpose of determining recipients of our Facebook advertisements. With this, we intend to ensure that the advertisements are only displayed to users, who have an interest in our information and services.</li>
                        <li>The processing of data by Facebook occurs within the scope of Facebook’s Data Utilization Policy. Accordingly, general information about the display of Facebook Ads, in the Data Utilization Policy of Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php. Specific information and details about the Facebook Pixel and its functionality are available in the help section of Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616</a>.</li>
                        <li>You can object to the recording by the Facebook Pixel and the use of your data for displaying Facebook Ads. In order to set which types of advertisements are displayed to you within Facebook, you can access the site set up by Facebook and follow the instructions there for use-based advertising: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>.

By subscribing to our newsletter, you are declaring your consent to the receipt and the described procedures.</li>
                        <li>Content of the newsletter: We only send newsletters, e-mails and additional electronic messages with marketing information (hereinafter referred to as “newsletter”) with the consent of the recipient or legal permission.

                        <li>Verification and logging: Successful registration for our newsletter only takes place if the e-mail address of the recipient has been verified beforehand. I.e. after the registration, you receive an e-mail, in which you are requested to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary, so that no one can login with third-party e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged, in order to verify the registration process in accordance with the legal requirements. This includes storing the time of registration and the time of confirmation, as well as the abbreviated IP address. The changes to your data stored with the E-mail Service Provider are also logged.</li>
                        <li>E-mail Service Provider: The delivery of the newsletter occurs using Mailjet GmbH, Rankestr. 21, 10789 Berlin, hereinafter referred to as “E-mail Service Provider”.

                        <li>Furthermore, according to its own information, the E-mail Service Provider may use these data in a pseudonymized form, i.e. without allocation to a user, for optimization or improvement of its own services, e.g. for technical optimization of the delivery and the display of the newsletter or for statistical purposes, in order to determine which countries the recipients come from. However, the E-mail Service Provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients, in order to write to them itself or disclose the data to third parties.</li>
                        <li>Success measurement – the newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file, which is retrieved by the E-mail Service Provider’s server when the newsletter is opened. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the retrieval, is collected. This information is used for the technical improvement of the service on the basis of the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior on the basis of their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or the access times. For the statistical surveys also include the determination of whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked on. For technical reasons, this information can be allocated to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our aim or that of the E-mail Service Provider, to monitor individual users. In fact, the purpose of the evaluations is for us to identify the reading habits of our users and to adapt our contents to them or send different contents in accordance with the interests of our users.</li>
                        <li>The delivery of the newsletter and the success measurement occur on the basis of a consent from the recipient in accordance with Art. 6 Subsection 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR in conjunction with Section 7 Subsection 2 No. 3 UWG [German Fair Trade Practices Act] or on the basis of legal permission in accordance with Section 7 Subsection 3 UWG.</li>
